# MRP2021
This repository contains the datasets and the jupyter notebooks from my Major Research Project implemented in Spring/Summer 2021 towards a Masters in DataScience and Analytics 
from Ryerson University, Canada.

The Datasets folders contains two datasets.

The first is the Cit-HEP dataset taken from SNAP. 
The citation dataset taken from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection(SNAP) made available by the Stanford University over the following link.

The second is a dataset created manually to record the current citations(ground-truth) from Google scholar.
